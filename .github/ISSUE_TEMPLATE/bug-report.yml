      description: |
        Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.

        If relevant, add a minimal example so that we can reproduce the error by running the action.
        It is very important for the example to be as succinct (minimal) as possible,
        so please take time to trim down any irrelevant configuration to help us debug efficiently.

        Please include:
        - Your workflow YAML configuration
        - The action logs showing the error
        - Expected behavior vs actual behavior

        If the workflow is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist
        and link it in the issue: https://gist.github.com.

        Please also paste or describe the results you observe instead of the expected results.
        If you observe an error, please paste the error message including the **full** output
        from the action logs.
        It may be relevant to wrap output in ```` ```triple quotes blocks``` ````.
